   @Takeaways
     i) Probable trends starts at crossover on/above 25 ( NOT BELOW)
         Crossovers below 25 leads to sideways and loose on brokerage rather than true trends
     i) Crossover should make a higher pivot above the previous pivot of opposite DMI ( Very Imp)
     iii) Trade at BREAKOUT or PullBACK ..?
