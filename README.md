### 2. Stochastic Indicator / RSI's(better brother)
  Measure the momentum of price.E.g Rocket going up in air must slow down before it turnsdown.
  Not to always short when overbought , impose with other charts ( MACD ) to identify longer trend.
  Entry trigger -> look for over sold making upward cuts(20%)
  Alternate to RSI when used with MACD Histogram and volume profile.

### 3.ADX & DMI(+) (-)
 To catch Momentum + Trade Direction + Chance of change in momentum.For trade the prime hunt should be volatility nedded for the movement alongside momentum.
      
   @Takeaways
     i) Probable trends starts at crossover on/above 25 ( NOT BELOW)
         Crossovers below 25 leads to sideways and loose on brokerage rather than true trends
     i) Crossover should make a higher pivot above the previous pivot of opposite DMI ( Very Imp)
     iii) Trade at BREAKOUT or PullBACK ..?
